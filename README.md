# Pre-requisite

If you don't have NodeJS installed, then please install the 'LTS' version of NodeJS [from this link](https://nodejs.org/en/). This is the first green button on the page and is the version with long term support.

# Instructions on how to start your project

* Step 1:  Clone the seed project to your local computer. Give it your own project name. This is done by running the following command:

  <code>$ git clone https://github.com/ashB100/fcc-project-seed-vanillajs.git your-project-name</code>

  <small>Note<sup>*</sup>: You don't have to type $, it is just there to show that you're in the command line prompt, Terminal in Mac and Console in Windows.</small>
  
* Step 2: Change directory to your project directory.  

  For example:
  
  <code>$ cd your-project-name</code>
  
* Step 3: Install the dependencies needed by your project by running the following command:

  <code>$ npm install</code>

* Step 4. Serve your application by running the following command:

  <code>$ npm run dev</code>
  
* Step 5. This should open your application in the browser. You will see a default message on the browser which you can replace with your own code in index.html. 

Now you can start working on your project!
